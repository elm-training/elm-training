module ElmArchitectureModules.SubModules exposing (..)

{-
A motivating example for this section is where you want multiple children that are independent instances of the same thing. TO-DON'Ts - things that I will never do. Cross them of if you accidentally did them.

Talk about forwarding things on to children, vs forwarding things on to parents.

Talk about cross-component communication.
