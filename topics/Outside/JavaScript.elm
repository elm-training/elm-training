{-
  The goal of Elm is to eliminate the need to write JS. Sometimes this is unavoidable. When you really need to interop with JS code, Elm makes this safe with ports.

  In Elm you treat JS as a third-party service.

  * Mention the `port` keyword at the beginning of the module declaration.
  * Show creating the Elm app manually in JS in `index.html`, running it with elm-live.
  * Show subscribing in JS side with app.ports.name.subscribe
  * Show harlem shake app

  Run this with `elm-live --port=8001 --open JavaScript.elm --output=elm.js`

  SEE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8f7wj_RcqYk for background.

{-

   * Comsuming data in Elm from JavaScript is just a subscription, which you already know how to do.
   * Show sending data back from Js to a port with app.ports.[name].send
   * Modify the example to pass in a callback to the harlemShake function. When we start change the model to show we are playing something, when it finishes change the model back to show we are done.
   * Caveat: you can't send Union types over ports.
   * Error handling in ports:

-- EXERCISE: Create a new port in Elm. In JavaScript, pass a second callback in to `harlemShake` that will send some data to that new port. In Elm, when you recieve that data, increment a `beatsDropped` counter on the model and render that in your view.
