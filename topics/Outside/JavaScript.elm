{-
    The goal of Elm is to eliminate the need to write JS. Sometimes this is unavoidable. When you really need to interop with JS code, Elm makes this safe with ports.

    In Elm you treat JS as a third-party service.

    * Show creating the Elm app manually in JS, running it with elm-live.
    * Show creating aport on the JS side with app.ports.name.subscribe
    * Sending stuff to it is as simple as calling a function
    * Show harlem shake app

   Run this with `elm-live --port=8001 --open JavaScript.elm --output=elm.js`

{-

   * Comsuming data in Elm from JavaScript is just a subscription, which you already know how to do.
   * Show sending data back from Js to a port with app.ports.[name].send
   * Modify the example to pass in a callback to the harlemShake function. When we start change the model to show we are playing something, when it finishes change the model back to show we are done.
   * Caveat: you can't send Union types over ports.
   * Error handling in ports:
