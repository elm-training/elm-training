    EXAMPLE: Stateful Components. Autocomplete

    Sometimes we want the state of a component to be opaque. In those cases, we do want to create a component more like The Elm Architecture.

    Let's create a basic autocomplete componentb

    1. Look nice out of the box
    2. Be packaged into a nice top-level view
    3. Expose its guts
    4. Allow for very differnet kinds of entries in the content box
    5. But work easily out of the box

    TODO create an autocomplete component :)

    See http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/thebritican/elm-autocomplete/latest

    What are the downsides of this design?

    EXERCISE: Write your own Autocomplete component using any design pattern.
