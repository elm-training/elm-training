   EXAMPLE: Comosable Children

   HTML lets me wrap things to add functionality. Let's say I make a box component/function. I don't have to change box to have it support layout. I can wrap it in a div!

   Div is very composable because it can hold anything inside. You don't have to explicitly program div to accept different kinds of content:
-}


box : String -> Float -> Float -> Html msg
box color width height =
    div
        [ style
            [ ( "background", color )
            , ( "width", (toString width) ++ "px" )
            , ( "height", (toString height) ++ "px" )
            ]
        ]
        []


boxesView : Html msg
boxesView =
    let
        container =
            [ ( "display", "flex" ) ]

        boxLayout =
            [ ( "margin-right", "10px" ) ]
    in
        div [ style container ]
            [ div [ style boxLayout ]
                [ box "red" 100 100 ]
            , div [ style boxLayout ]
                [ box "green" 100 100 ]
            , div [ style boxLayout ]
                [ box "blue" 100 100 ]
            ]

   EXAMPLE: Can we do the same thing for our toggle button?

   What if some toggle buttons might want to have fancy content? Like bolding some of the text, images, or icons?

   We COULD try to make toggleButton support all of the above, or we could rely on composition once again: pass in the content!

   See toggleButton2 in ./Examples/Button.elm


   Now it's like div. It works with ANY content. Toggle Button doesn't have to know ahead of time what kind of content it wants to support.
-}


order : Order.Model -> Html Msg3
order model =
    let
        bigText =
            [ ( "font-size", "18px" )
            , ( "font-weight", "bold" )
            ]

        -- live code
    in
        div []
            [ Button.toggleButton2 Food
                model.wantsFood
                [ span
                    [ style bigText ]
                    [ text "Hot " ]
                , span [] [ text "Food" ]
                ]
              -- We can have the content respond to the state, without having to change toggleButton to support it
            , Button.toggleButton2 Drink
                model.wantsDrink
                [ text ("Drink: " ++ yesNo model.wantsDrink) ]
            ]


yesNo : Bool -> String
yesNo val =
    if val then
        "Yes"
    else
        "No"

   LEARN: Library vs Application Specific

   Try to write components so that they could be used in any application, not just yours. The resulting design will be much more composable (useful in a more places without changing it)

   EXAMPLE: Toggle Button as a Library

   Right now our toggle button is application specific, because it has the styles baked in. Let's make those those composable

   We COULD pass in the base and active styles, then make the buttonIsActive function more generic, but even better: let's have toggleButton work with any function of the form:

       Bool -> List (Style, Style)

   See toggleButtonGeneric in ./Examples/Button.elm

   ------------------------------------------------------


   EXAMPLE: Multi-state buttons

   What if we want a "toggle" button that supports more than one state?

   See stateButton in ./Examples/Button.elm

type Hunger
    = Full
    | Ok
    | Starving


nextHunger : Hunger -> Hunger

        Full ->

        Ok ->

        Full ->

        Ok ->

        Starving ->
            Button.button ++ Button.hyperActive


hungerView : Model -> Html Msg
hungerView model =
    div []
        [ Button.stateButton

            }
            [ text ("Hungry? " ++ toString model.hunger) ]
        ]



{-

   Let's tie everything together so we can display it one page. Notice how I use the elm architecture here, because I'm displaying multiple views.

-}


type alias Model =
    { order : Order.Model
    , hunger : Hunger
    }


init : Model
init =
    { order = Order.init
    , hunger = Full
    }


type Msg
    = Hunger Hunger
    | Order Order.Msg3


update : Msg -> Model -> Model
update msg model =
    case msg of
        Hunger val ->
            { model | hunger = val }

        Order msg ->
            { model | order = Order.update3 msg model.order }


view : Model -> Html Msg
view model =
    div []
        [ div [] [ boxesView ]
        , div [] [ Html.map Order <| order model.order ]
        , div [] [ hungerView model ]
        ]


main =
    Html.beginnerProgram
        { model = init
        , view = view
        , update = update
        }



{-
   EXERCISE

   Make a reusable tabs component. Focus on creating composable functions.

   Assume you will be publishing the component to package.elm-lang.org, so separate the styles from the view and logic.

   The tabs should:
       Display different content depending on which tab is active
       Make it clear visually which tab is active
       Expose any logic so users can compose their own implementations
